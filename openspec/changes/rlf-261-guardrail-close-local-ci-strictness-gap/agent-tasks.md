## Resolve PR merge conflicts (2026-06-15T21:22:47.305Z)

- [x] Resolve PR merge conflicts. Read the error block below, fix the underlying problem (do not just retry the failing command), then check this box.

```
The PR for this change has merge conflicts with `main`.
Steps:
1. `git fetch origin main` then merge `main` into the current branch (`git merge origin/main`). Do NOT rebase.
2. Resolve conflicts in the files git lists.
3. Stage and commit the resolution as a new merge commit. Do NOT amend existing commits.
4. Push the resolved branch with `git push origin ralph/rlf-261`. Never force-push.
   The post-task harness will NOT push for you in conflict-fix mode — you own the push.
   If the push is rejected, inspect the rejection output and react inline before retrying:
     - **non-fast-forward** (someone else pushed to `ralph/rlf-261`):
       `git fetch origin ralph/rlf-261` then `git merge origin/ralph/rlf-261` to bring their
       changes in as a new merge commit, re-resolve any new conflicts, and retry the push.
       Do NOT rebase and do NOT `--force` / `--force-with-lease` — work on the remote must
       never be overwritten.
     - **pre-push hook failure** (lint, typecheck, tests): fix the underlying problem locally,
       `git add` + `git commit` as a new commit (NEVER `--amend` an existing commit),
       then retry the push.
     - **ref-update policy rejection** (branch protection, required reviews): log the rejection
       message and stop — this requires human intervention; do not force past it.
   Only stop after exhausting the in-context fix. The push must succeed before this iteration ends.
